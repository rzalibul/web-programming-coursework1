						Located at the epicentre of Norfolk’s finest attractions, guests at Haveringland Hall will find themselves only a short drive away from fine golf at Weston Park and Barnham Broom, and walking and cycling paths such as The Marriots Way, The Bure Valley and Weavers Way. There is easy touring to the North Norfolk Coast, with Holt and Burnham Market (known as the Hamptons of Norfolk) just 12 miles, with delicatessen and excellent shopping, first class pubs and restaurants. Cromer (possibly most famous for its crabs), Sheringham and Caister all offering sandy beaches. Within a 30-minute drive are the Norfolk Broads at Wroxham, where visitors can hire boats for the day, or alternatively enjoy a leisurely day cruise. The nature reserve of Hickling Broad is a haven for migrating birds, including sandpipers, osprey and spoonbills; it also offers excellent fishing, especially for pike and bream, as well as a number of nature trails to explore.
Full of cultural attractions, the city of Norwich lies just 20 minutes away, offering interests to suit all tastes; from history and architecture to art galleries, shops and leisure activities. The splendid cathedral boasts some of Britain’s finest Gothic architecture with carvings adorning its interior, while high on a hill stands the 12th-century Norman castle, which now houses the Castle Museum. Within driving distance are Somerleyton Hall and the NT properties of 17th-century Blickling Hall (where open-air concerts are staged in summer), Felbrigg Hall, Oxburgh Hall and Sheringham Park. For family entertainment, there is a wealth of adventure activities and parks nearby – choose from Dinosaur Adventure Park, Thigby Wildlife, Pettitts Animal Adventure and Wroxham Barns, to name but a few. Shops 3 miles.
